# ROS_ImagePublisher
Basic ROS image package for parsing image files of a directory and publishing them as image messages

## Acknowledgements
It's a package that is oriented towards processing the images extacted with [pyOniExtractor](https://github.com/roccopietrini/pyOniExtractor) python tool.

Following the implementation's rational and with small code adjustments, this can be a more general ROS image publishing tool
